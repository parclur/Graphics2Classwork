// ****TO-DO: 
//	1) declare varyings to read from vertex shader
//		-> *test all varyings by outputting them as color
//	2) declare uniforms for textures (diffuse, specular)
//	3) sample textures and store as temporary values
//		-> *test all textures by outputting samples
//	4) declare fixed-sized arrays for lighting values and other related values
//		-> *test lighting values by outputting them as color
//		-> one day this will be made easier... soon, soon...
//	5) implement Phong shading calculations
//		-> *save time where applicable
//		-> diffuse, specular, attenuation
//		-> remember to be modular (e.g. write a function)
//	6) calculate Phong shading model for one light
//		-> *test shading values (diffuse, specular) by outputting them as color
//	7) calculate Phong shading for all lights
//		-> *test shading values
//	8) add all light values appropriately
//	9) calculate final Phong model (with textures) and copy to output
//		-> *test the individual shading totals
//		-> use alpha channel from diffuse sample for final alpha
